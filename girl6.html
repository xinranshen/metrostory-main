        Days pass. His face faded in your memory, but you still remember how
        surprise you were when you receive that portrait of you. You remember
        how his hands in gloves accidentally touched yours when he handed the
        piece of paper over.
      </div>

      <div class="narration" style="padding-top: 200px; text-align: center">
        Every time you look up at your wall, you see the pinned portrait. It
        seems that you are in gradually oblivion of the details of that
        interesting encounter. You don't want that to happen. But you can do
        nothing about it.
      </div>
      <div class="narration" style="padding-top: 100px; text-align: center">
        You still study in the Caf√© with friends. You always sit in the barstool
        near the window. Same with this afternoon, but when you and your friend
        find your usual seat with cups of hot Matcha Lattes, you noticed someone
        familiar.
      </div>
      <div class="narration" style="padding-top: 200px; text-align: center">
        It's a guy sitting at the corner, drawing something on a sketchbook. Is
        that him? You are not sure. You don't remember how he looks. However,
        you are reminded of that day in the metro. There is a similar guy who
        sketched you and gave you the portrait.
      </div>
      <div class="narration" style="padding-top: 200px; text-align: center">
        Portrait... Wait. He's looking at you. The guy sitting on the corner is
        looking at you as he draw. You pretend being interested in the Stats
        assignment your friends are talking about, but can't help paying
        attention to him.
      </div>
      <div class="narration" style="padding-top: 200px; text-align: center">
        He stands up, and walks towards you.
      </div>
      <div class="narration" style="padding-top: 200px; text-align: center">
        He puts something on your table without even looking at you. It's a
        piece of folded paper. He walks away fastly.
