        But you still remember how surprise you were when you receive that
        portrait of you. You remember how his hands in gloves accidentally
        touched yours when he handed the piece of paper over.

        You still study in the Café with friends. You always sit in the barstool
        near the window. Same with this afternoon, but when you and your friend
        find your usual seat with a cup of Expresso Machiato, you noticed
        someone familiar.
      </div>
      <div class="narration" style="padding-top: 200px; text-align: center">
        It's a guy sitting at the corner, drawing something on a sketchbook. Is
        that him? You are not sure. You don't remember how he looks. However,
        you are reminded of that day in the metro. There is a similar guy who
        sketched you and gave you the portrait.
      </div>
      <div class="narration" style="padding-top: 200px; text-align: center">
        Portrait... Wait. He's looking at you. The guy sitting on the corner is
        looking at you as he draw. You pretend being interested in the Stats
        assignment your friends are talking about, but can't help paying
        attention to him.
      </div>
      <div class="narration" style="padding-top: 200px; text-align: center">
        He stands up, and walks towards you.
      </div>
      <div class="narration" style="padding-top: 200px; text-align: center">
        He puts something on your table without even looking at you. It's a
        piece of folded paper. He walks away fastly, almost running away.
