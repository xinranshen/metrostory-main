        You begin thinking about the girl all day long looking back at the
        photo, but you are too shy to reach out. You know she got off from the
        metro at the university place, and probably is a student or faculty
        member of that college. But you feel so afraid to come and find her. You
        are just a broke artist who is definitely not the handsome kind. You are
        afraid to hear what she thinks about you.
