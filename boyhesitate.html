        Your phone rings. It's your boss calling you to go back and finish the MVP because you will be presenting your project to a client in a few days. But she might be in that Starbucks, and you might see her in a few seconds, only if you cross the road and push that door.

      <div class="narration" style="padding-top: 100px">
       "It will only take 15 minutes. Just grab a coffee and leave. " You say to yourself. But your boss is terrible. If you can't find her there, it's gonna be sunk cost. You don't want to be fired for being late for work.
