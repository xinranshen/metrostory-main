       You are a broke artist who loves to sketch portraits for strangers on the metro as a daily excercise. You keep these little portraits in your sketchbook and never show them to others. 
       It's another sleepy afternoon in a crowded subway car. You finally find a seat in West 4th Street Station, take out the sketchbook and a pen, starting to find a model.

   <div class="narration" style="padding-top: 200px;text-align: center;">
    And you see her. Standing at the right opposite from you.
   </div>
   <div class="narration" style="padding-top: 100px;text-align: center;">
    She's in a sky blue coat. The book she is reading makes her stand out in the entire carriage of people looking at their phones. Her side face looks so gentle and serene. You can't move your eyes from her. But the angle she stands seem to be not easy to sketch from the place you sit.

   <div class="narration" style="padding-top: 200px;text-align: center;">
     "Should I draw her?" You ask yourself.
